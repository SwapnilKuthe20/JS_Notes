::: flat() :::

flat() is use when you need to convert a 
multi-dimensional array (nested arrays) into a single array.

flat() Considerations ::
If you pass Infinity as the depth, 
it will recursively flatten the entire structure no matter how deeply nested it is.
flat() does not modify the original array; it returns a new one.
