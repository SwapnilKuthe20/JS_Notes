Built-in Objects ::

1. console 
2. Math
3. JSON
4. localStorage

  these are the built-in objects provided by the js.

:::: JSON ::::
 - Stands for Javascript Object Notation.
 - It is similar to js objecct.
 - but has less features.

:::: Syntax ::::

	{
	     "Name" : "Swapnil",
	     "Age"  : 20,
	 "Location" : "Nagpur"
	}

- All properties and strings must use double quote ("")in JSON.
- JSON does not support single quote ('').
- JSON does not support function.


Que - why we use JSON instead of js object ?
Ans - JS object only make sense in js. 
       but JSON object can be understand almost every programming lannguage.
	so the JSON is more universal.

 	due to this reason we use JSON :
	- when we send data between 2 computers that might use different programming language.
	- We also use JSON when we store data.

  ::: JSON object help us convert js object to JSON.

  for eg :
	// JS Object ::	
	const Student ={
			 Name : "Swapnil",
			 Age  : 23,
			 Location : "Nagpur"
			}

	// Convert above Student obj into JSON object.

	    JSON.stringify(Student);
